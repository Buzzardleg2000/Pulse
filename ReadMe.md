BioGears 
===========

BioGears is a C++ based, open source, multi-platform (Windows, Mac, and Linux), comprehensive human physiology
engine that will drive medical education, research, and training technologies. 
BioGears enables accurate and consistent physiology
simulation across the medical community. The engine can be used as a
standalone application or integrated with simulators, sensor interfaces,
and models of all fidelities.

BioGears high-level objectives include:
-   Create a publicly available physiology research platform that
    enables accurate and consistent simulated physiology across training
    applications
-   Lower the barrier to create medical training content
-   Engage the community to develop and extend physiology models
-   Meet the training needs of the military
-   Expand the body of knowledge regarding the use of simulated
    physiology for medical education
