Usage: dockcross [container-name] [pulse-source-directory] [build-directory] [existing build directory]


Example Usage: dockcross linux-x64-clang ./Pulse/engine ./builds

A new directory will be created under the provided build directory to build in
The directory name will be 'pulse-engine-' and the container name.
For example: pulse-engine-linux-x64-clang

Options:
  container-name        This is the name of the container to build in
                        https://hub.docker.com/u/dockcross
                        Only provide the string after 'dockcross/'
                        example : linux-x64-clang

  pulse-soure-directory The relative directory of the pulse source code

  build-directory       The relative directory to build pulse
