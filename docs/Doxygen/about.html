              <h1>What is Pulse?</h1>
              <p>The Pulse Physiology Engine is a C++ based, open source, multi-platform (Windows, Mac, and Linux), comprehensive human physiology simulator that will drive medical education, research, and training technologies. The engine enables accurate and consistent physiology simulation across the medical community. The engine can be used as a standalone application or integrated with simulators, sensor interfaces, and models of all fidelities. We are advancing the engine and exploring new avenues of research, such as pediatrics, patient-specific modeling and virtual surgery planning/rehearsal.</p>
              <p>There are <a href="https://pulse.kitware.com/published.html">Publications</a> on several systems and clinical scenarios.</p>
