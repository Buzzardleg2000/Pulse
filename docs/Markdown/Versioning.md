## Pulse Integration (Current new feature set)

- Software Architecture Improvements
  - Combined DataModelBindings, CommonDataModel and PulseEngine into a single Pulse library
    - This single library can be built as a shared/dynamic library or a static (default) library
  - Implement system/patient validation framework in Python
    - Provides access to more discrete modules in our validation pipeline for more versatile use
  - Initial architecture for automated validation
    - Currently only AirwayObstruction has been migrated
    - Created a xlsx template for automating the our validation of our models (is currently being done by hand)
    - The validation pipeline can also create a single doxygen report with a plot file and md files associated with an xlsx
    - Added the ability to create vitals monitor and ventilator monitor plots from CSV files
  - Created an Advance To Stable Action, this will run the engine until stable criteria is met
  - Threaded execution of a group of scenarios now can be provided a single json file containing all scenario to run
    - Information for every executed scenario is then updated in the provided file:
      - The locations of the: scenario file and its generated log file, and csv file
      - Various error states if encountered: Unable to initialize and why, if there were any other errors encountered
  - Post processing pipeline
    - Written in python, allows us to process a log and csv file generated from a scenario and pull out (and even generate new) data into a more machine learning friendly format
      - Unstructure Text Module looks at map of vitals to a string vector and randomly takes strings based on the vitals values to create an unstructured description of the simulation at that time. The strings and bounds are read in from a spreadsheet
  - Testing Utils
    - Add a run.cmake option to generate a config of all the failures for a quick and easy rebase (once they have been reviewed and approved of course)
    - Remove action vertical lines in our verification plots of actions that occur many many times. These actions are usually testing sensor driven inputs and make data interpretation difficult.

- Physiology Model Improvements
  - Dyspnea
    - Split single severity into a Respiration Rate severity and Tidal Volume severity
    - This allows users to define breathing impairments with more precision
    - **Note** any previous scenarios using Dyspnea severity should apply that value to the Tidal Volume severity
  - Mechanical Ventilator Model
    - Ventilation will immediately stop at limits
  - Modifier Actions (SECardiovascularMechanicsModification, SERespiratoryMechanicsModification)
    - We now provide 2 new actions to modify the respiratory and cardiovascular model parameters
    - For example, you can provide a multipliers to modify the heart rate, respiration rate, systemic vascular and pulmonary resistances
    - This provides the end user more low level control to fine tune the physiology to their specific needs
  - The application of drug pharmacodynamics changes to the cardiovascular system now include pulse pressure as well as mean arterial pressure
    - Acute stress is more inline with validation data
